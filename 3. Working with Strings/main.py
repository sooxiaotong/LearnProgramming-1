text1 = "Hello "  # This is the first string, note the space in the back
text2 = "Fred"  # This is the second string.
print(text1)  # Output text1
print(text2)  # /Output text2
print(text1, text2)  # Outputs both of them

text3 = text1 + text2  # They can be combined
print(text3)  # This have the same effect as the third output
